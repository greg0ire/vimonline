<h1>Trivia</h1>

<h1>Miscellaneous and Trivial Bits</h1>
<p>
Here you can find other bits of vimaphernalia that don't quite fit
anywhere else.  Mostly, this now consists of various images, but you
can expect more weird things to pile up here as time goes by.
</p>

<h4>Logos and Icons</h4>
<p>
There's just one official Vim logo -- it's the one you see up at the
top of this page.  The logo, as well as a number of variations on it,
are available <a href='logos.php'>here</a>.  There are also a number of
icons in different formats.
</p>

<h4>Animation</h4>
<p>
Wolfram Esser has made an animation with the Vim logo.
This is quite a bit of fun to see and hear.
The animation is available in various formats and two resolutions
<A HREF="http://www.derwok.de/2d-3d/3d/vimlogo/">here</A>.
Don't be suprised if downloading is a bit slow, the files are 1.5 to 9
Mbyte.
Have fun!
</p>

<h4>Buttons and Propaganda</h4>
<p>
<a href='buttons.php'>This section</a> is replete with buttons suitable for
tacking onto web pages.  You can proclaim your support of Vim through a
128 by 38 button!
</p>

<h4>Other Weirdness</h4>
<p>
Did you know that Vim can get your dishes clean?  Did you know there's
a shop dedicated to Vim on Broadway in NYC?  We've got
<a href='weird.php'>proof</a>.
