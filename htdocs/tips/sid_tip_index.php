This is a place where users of the vim editor can add their favorite commands, macros and other 
assorted tips to a common database. While the vim distribution comes with a rich set of documentation 
it is often hard to find a place to start when trying to incrementally learn how to use the editor.

<span class="sidebarheader">Why tips?</span>
<p>
When I realized how much I was learning from the vim list alone I thought it would be great to have 
a place that the community could maintain a list of their favorite vim gems. The overall goal is to have a place you can visit when you are in a vim learning mood or when you "discover" something particularly powerful and want to share it with other vim users.
